"""LLM judge for ClawBench: decide if an intercepted HTTP request fulfills the instruction.

Stage 2 of the two-stage scoring rubric:
  Stage 1 — request matches eval_schema regex+method (set by interceptor → run-meta.intercepted).
  Stage 2 — judge: given task instruction + intercepted request body, does the request
            actually do what the user asked?

Final pass = stage1 AND stage2.

Uses only stdlib (urllib.request) so no extra deps. Loads model config from models.yaml
the same way run.py does, supports api_type in
{openai-completions, openai-responses, anthropic-messages}.

A user gave a natural-language INSTRUCTION to an autonomous browser agent.
